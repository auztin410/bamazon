A Node.js application that simulates an ordering system like Amazon.

Always you to select an item from a table, choose how many you want and will tell you what you owe.

It also has a manager side to restock items, see which items have low stock, and add new products.

I did this use Node.js, MYSQL database, and node packages(inquirer and console.table).
